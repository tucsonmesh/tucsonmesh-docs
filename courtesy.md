**Courtesy and Respect on Installs**  

You, the installer, are the public face of NYCMesh! Courtesy, respect, friendliness and professionalism will give install clients a great first impression of our organization and will encourage them to become active members. 

Before leaving for the install, hydrate, eat something and use the bathroom.

Allow sufficient time to get to the install. Arrive on time and if you can’t help being late, contact your client and co-installers to update them on your estimated arrival time.

When first meeting a client, introduce yourself by name and explain how you plan to carry out the install. Ask them if they have any questions. Confirm that they will be able to host you for the expected duration of the install. Be polite, friendly, and smile, and be respectful of their personal space.

During the course of the install, have a friendly conversation with your client about the mission of NYCMesh and encourage them to get involved as a volunteer. Invite them to our next [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/nycmesh/) .

If you encounter any unsafe conditions on site and decide to cancel or postpone the install, respectfully explain the situation to the client and tell them what they can do to rectify the situation (in case of hazards) or how to reschedule (in case of bad weather conditions).

Be sensitive to cultural and social differences, such as:
*   Attitudes towards physical contact. Some people may not feel comfortable shaking hands, for example.
*   Wearing or not wearing outdoor footwear in the apartment. Ask for permission to wear shoes indoors if in doubt.
*   Different languages. Be patient with clients whom you don’t share a first language with.

Ask your client to lead you to their roof. If they do not want to or are physically unable to climb the stairs / ladder to the roof, ask them to explain how to access the roof and request that they point out any hazards.

Ask the client to show you around their apartment. Keep to areas essential to the install and ask permission to use their bathroom or access other parts of the apartment as needed.  Remember to respect the client’s privacy.

Do not track dirt or water into the apartment. Make sure to wipe your shoes when entering and keep off carpets where possible.

If you need to move any furniture or objects, ask your client for permission or ask them to help you. Do not touch the client’s belongings unless they must be moved as part of the install.

Discuss options for cabling into the apartment with your client. Ask for permission before carrying out any drilling.

If the install is taking longer than planned, tell the client. Confirm they will be able to host you for the extended install duration.

Maintain a tidy workspace and clean up after yourself outside and inside the apartment. Leave the site in the condition you found it.

Carry out the install in an efficient manner. Do not goof off or waste time.

If you run into installation issues and feel frustrated, try to maintain a positive attitude when communicating with the client and with your fellow installers.

Have a friendly conversation with your client about NYCMesh and encourage them to get involved as a volunteer!
