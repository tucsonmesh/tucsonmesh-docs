Before using a NanoStation, you should check with us that you are in range of another NanoStation. Some use the NanoStation when they are out of range of the mesh network using the built-in tinc vpn connection.
Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to read our FAQ on the main site.
Also, please fill out the Join form.
When finished, read how to install a NanoStation outdoors</description></item><item><title>Watchdog</title><link>https://mackncheesiest.github.io/tucsonmesh-docs/software/watchdog/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mackncheesiest.github.io/tucsonmesh-docs/software/watchdog/</guid><description>Wireless networks have a bit of a reputation for instability. Modern hardware has fixed most hardware problems, but there is work that needs to be done to make the firmware reliable. You can do this with &amp;ldquo;watchdog&amp;rdquo; scripts. I haven&amp;rsquo;t had to reboot a router that is running our watchdog script.
Our firmware image (based on qMp) comes with a &amp;ldquo;bmx6health&amp;rdquo; script that checks whether the mesh software is running correctly and restarts it if necessary.</description></item></channel></rss>
