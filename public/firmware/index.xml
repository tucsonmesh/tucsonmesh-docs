In general never use a &amp;ldquo;.0&amp;rdquo; release. It is beta quality and will probably have serious bugs that may be fixed by .1 or .2 version.
Ubiquiti have two very separate product lines with different firmware, AirMAX and UniFi
Don&amp;rsquo;t use the latest firmware from Ubiquiti! Use the stable versions below-
AirMAX
We currently use 8.7.1 on most CPE (like the LiteBeams)</description></item><item><title>MikroTik Firmware</title><link>https://mackncheesiest.github.io/tucsonmesh-docs/firmware/mikrotik/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mackncheesiest.github.io/tucsonmesh-docs/firmware/mikrotik/</guid><description>MikroTik routerOS 6 firmware is generally stable. We are using 6.47.8
Do not use version 7 or version 6.48
routerOS 6
Download 6.47.8 OmniTik (mipsbe) here and SXTsq (arm) here
Remember that OmniTiks use the &amp;ldquo;mipsbe&amp;rdquo; firmware and SXT&amp;rsquo;s use the &amp;ldquo;arm&amp;rdquo; firmware due to different processors.
We have had many crashes with 6.48 so don&amp;rsquo;t use it.
We are testing some omnitiks with 6.49.2 but this is also not recommended</description></item><item><title>Custom Firmware (old)</title><link>https://mackncheesiest.github.io/tucsonmesh-docs/firmware/custom/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mackncheesiest.github.io/tucsonmesh-docs/firmware/custom/</guid><description>Old firmware Repositories Old firmware build instructions are in our nycmeshfeed repo&amp;rsquo;s README file.

The LEDs repeat the pattern: device boots up, power eventually turns blue, then 1-5 turn orange and reboots. Rinse and repeat.
Solution Use netinstall to flash a fresh firmware on the router. This guide assumes Linux, though both Linux and Windows are supported. This should work for any RouterBOARD based device.
Install netinstall on your laptop from mikrotik, and make sure it is in your command line path Download the firmware you want to reset to (e.</description></item></channel></rss>
