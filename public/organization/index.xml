Basically we work on a system of trust. As we get to know new people we trust that they will do the right thing, and we gradually share access to locations and machines, and let them lead installs. During Covid it is obviously difficult to get to know people since we don&amp;rsquo;t get to socialize with everyone at our meetups, so zooms are the new way.</description></item><item><title>Master Plan</title><link>https://mackncheesiest.github.io/tucsonmesh-docs/organization/plan/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mackncheesiest.github.io/tucsonmesh-docs/organization/plan/</guid><description>Our basic plan is to create hubs and supernodes across the city so it is easy for any building to connect to our network. We think this will take about 50 tall buildings spread across all neighborhoods. We currently only have 3 supernodes and about 5 major hub nodes, so we are still a few years away from our goal.
This is a presentation from early 2018 on the technical side of the master plan.</description></item><item><title>Outreach Materials</title><link>https://mackncheesiest.github.io/tucsonmesh-docs/organization/outreach/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mackncheesiest.github.io/tucsonmesh-docs/organization/outreach/</guid><description>NYC Mesh Member Guide (digital)

While we provide an alternative connection to the Internet and thus serve as an alternative to the big NYC ISPs, we are first and foremost a community that supports a community network.
That being said, reliability is something we are trying to push into the 99.9 percentile as the vast majority of members rely on this network for their daily lives.</description></item><item><title>Workflow</title><link>https://mackncheesiest.github.io/tucsonmesh-docs/organization/workflow/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mackncheesiest.github.io/tucsonmesh-docs/organization/workflow/</guid><description>Overview Join Form
Everything begins when a user fills out our Join Form.
Submitting it assigns the user a node number, sends a support ticket, and adds a row to a spredsheet in Google Docs we refer to as our &amp;ldquo;main spreadsheet.&amp;rdquo;
Main Spreadsheet
New nodes are displayed as gray dots on our map. They are rendered from the spreadsheet using the map-nodes code on our Github.
Support Ticketing
We use OSTicket for support tickets</description></item></channel></rss>
