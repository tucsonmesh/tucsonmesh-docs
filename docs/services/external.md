# External services

These are services used by Tucson Mesh that aren't hosted on hardware directly connected to the Mesh.

- [GitHub](https://github.com/tucsonmesh): Hosts version control repositories for custon management code, and these documents. We use the [Pages](https://pages.github.com/) service to host the [Configuration Generator](https://tucsonmesh.github.io/tucsonmesh-configgen/) and this documentation site.
- Google Sites: Hosts the main Tucson Mesh website.
- Google Docs: Legacy and nontechnical documentation, working documents for planning and visioning.
- Slack: Tucson Mesh's instance is [tucsonmesh.slack.com](https://tucsonmesh.slack.com). Builds community around the Mesh, the place to ask for support with connectivity, coordination for tech projects and community events. We're experimenting with tracking support requests using the [lists feature](https://slack.com/features/task-list).
- Trello: Manage new node requests, installations and track details about connected nodes.
- UISP: Used to monitor and administer Ubiquity devices on the Mesh.
