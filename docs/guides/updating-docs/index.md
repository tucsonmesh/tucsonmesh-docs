# Updating this documentation

The Tucson Mesh documentation site is just specially-formatted text files, processed by open source software and turned into a static website. This guide covers how to make changes to the documentation and the technologies that make that possible.

This documentation is written as [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files that are turned into a website using [MKDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the [Material for MKDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme.

If you just want to make some changes, check out [Editing existing documentation pages](editing-docs.md).

It's probably helpful to read the [Writing with Markdown](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/#writing-with-markdown) section of the [MKDocs User Guide](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/).

You'll have the best experience editing this documentation if you have an understanding of the difference between absolute and relative paths and URLs. [Creating links](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Creating_links) from the Mozilla Developer Network [Structuring content with HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content) tutorial has a good description of these concepts.
