# Editing existing documentation pages

This is a guide for editing existing pages on this documentation site.

This guide shows how to use GitHub's web-based editor because it's easy to reach it from the documentation site and does not require installing any software.

## For close collaborators

You can use links from the public documentation site to edit the page's source using GitHub's web interface.

### Prerequisites

- You have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. [Sign up](https://github.com/signup) is free.
- You have been granted commit access to the [tucsonmesh-docs repository](https://github.com/tucsonmesh/tucsonmesh-docs) by someone in the Mesh admin group.
- You have some familiarity with the Markdown markup language. Reading about its [basic syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) will probably be enough. Don't worry! Markdown was designed to be easily readable and you can probably figure out the syntax from what's already in the file.

### Make sure you're logged into your GitHub account

For the smoothest editing experience, make sure you're logged in to your GitHub account before you start editing pages.

Visit [https://github.com/login](https://github.com/login) in your preferred browser and complete the login flow. 

### Visit the page you want to edit on the documentation site

Visit [the documentation site](https://tucsonmesh.github.io/tucsonmesh-docs/) in the same browser that you used to log in to GitHub. 

Click the <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" style="width: 1rem"><path d="M10 20H6V4h7v5h5v3.1l2-2V8l-6-6H6c-1.1 0-2 .9-2 2v16c0 1.1.9 2 2 2h4zm10.2-7c.1 0 .3.1.4.2l1.3 1.3c.2.2.2.6 0 .8l-1 1-2.1-2.1 1-1c.1-.1.2-.2.4-.2m0 3.9L14.1 23H12v-2.1l6.1-6.1z"></path></svg> icon to the right of the page's title. 

This will take you to the edit page on GitHub for the Markdown file that generates the page you want to edit.

### Make your edits and save the changes

Edit the text to reflect the changes you want to make.

You can click on the `Preview` tab above the text editing area to see what your changes look like.

Once you're done, click the `Commit changes` button to the upper-right of the text editing area.

Enter a `Commit message`. There will be a default, but ideally you'll add something more descriptive. Additionally, you can write an `Extended description`. The description should describe the motivation for your changes rather than summarizing what you changed. Both of these won't be visible to readers of the documentation site, but are useful for other editors to review or understand changes.

Finally, click the `Commit changes` button.

### You're done!

Your changes have been saved, and in a few minutes, the public site will be rebuilt and your changes will be visible. 

## For others

We need to write step-by-step instructions about how people who are not close collaborators can submit updates to the documentation. Generally speaking, this documentation is hosted in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tucsonmesh/tucsonmesh-docs). You can [fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo), commit the desired changes to your fork and send us a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
