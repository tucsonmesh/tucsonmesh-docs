# Check the line of sight

## Get on the roof

Carefully climb up on your roof. Be sure to observe the [ladder safety guidelines](../ladder-safety.md).  

## Find the LiteBeam 

Walk to where your LiteBeam is currently installed. Be sure to watch out for uneven surfaces, conduit, cables or anything else that could cause you to trip.

!!! warning "ðŸ“· Photo needed!" 

    Insert photo of an installed LiteBeam on someoneâ€™s roof.

## Check the line of sight

Standing next to the LiteBeam, orient yourself to face [Tucson House](https://maps.app.goo.gl/u6aaPianA1ueBTkR9).

    Insert photo of the entire Tucson House building from someoneâ€™s roof.

From this position, check to see if you have a clear line of sight to the top of the building where the white masts are installed. If you have binoculars, they can help locate the masts.

Check for any large obstructions blocking your view of the masts such as buildings, trees, power lines or poles.

    Insert photo of the top of Tucson House from someoneâ€™s rooftop with the masts circled.

If you have a clear line of sight, proceed to the [next section](realign-litebeam.md) of this guide.

## If the line of sight isn't clear

If you do not have a clear line of sight from where the LiteBeam is currently installed, is there another area on your roof with a better line of sight where the equipment could potentially be moved?  

!!! warning "ðŸ“· Photo needed!" 

    Insert photo take from a rooftop showing obstructions.

Take photos of the following:  

- Location where the LiteBeam is currently located. 
- The view from where the LiteBeam is located looking toward Tucson House.
- The location that seems to have a better line of site to Tucson House, being sure to show where the antenna mount could be installed.  
- The view from the better location looking toward Tucson House.

Send the photos along with any additional details that could help others interpret them, such as "the router is currently on the northwest corner of the roof." Be sure to include your network number in the message.

Send the photos and additional information either as a message to the [\#user-support](https://tucsonmesh.slack.com/archives/C03P19L1WBF) channel in the [Tucson Mesh Slack](https://tucsonmesh.slack.com/) or as an email to [support@tucsonmesh.net](mailto:support@tucsonmesh.net).   

If you do not have a clear line of sight from where the LiteBeam is currently installed, it is still worth attempting to [realign the device](realign-litebeam.md) toward the masts on Tucson House. Although the connection may not be optimal, it may be strong enough to meet your needs and avoid the need to relocate the equipment.
