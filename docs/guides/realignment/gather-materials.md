# Realignment: Gather required materials 

Before you start the realignment, make sure that you have the following equipment and information:

- The "network number" of your node.
    - If you don't know your number, you can ask on the [#user-support](https://tucsonmesh.slack.com/archives/C03P19L1WBF) channel of the [Slack](https://tucsonmesh.slack.com/).
- Password to log into the administration interface of the LiteBeam.
    - To get a unique password for your node, send a message to [#user-support](https://tucsonmesh.slack.com/archives/C03P19L1WBF) channel of the [Slack](https://tucsonmesh.slack.com/), or email [support@tucsonmesh.net](mailto:support@tucsonmesh.net). Be sure to include your network number in the message.
- Ladder to access rooftop.
- Laptop computer or mobile phone with WiFi capabilities and a web browser.
- Google Earth: If you want to do a preliminary check of the line of site from your rooftop to the supernode, you can use [Google Earth Pro on desktop](https://www.google.com/earth/about/versions/).
- Binoculars (optional): It's much easier to check line of site with a pair of binoculars.
