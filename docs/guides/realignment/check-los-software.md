# Use mapping tools to plan your realignment

## Orient yourself to the supernode

Before climbing on your roof, use mapping software to figure out the direction of the supernode from your home.

This will help you know which direction to look from your rooftop to check the line of sight. It will also help give you an idea of which wireless network to connect to for the strongest signal.

## Virtually check your line of sight 

- Confirm the exact location of the LightBeam is on the rooftop.
- Check line of sight between the LightBeam and the supernode using Google Earth. To do this, follow the instructions at [Guide to Google Earth](https://startyourownisp.com/posts/guide-to-google-earth/).
- Note landmarks for helping to align the supernode. Idenfity specific buildings, trees, etc, to avoid so that you can get the clearest line of sight to the supernode.
