# Realignment

!!! info "How can this documentation be improved?" 

    - Clarify whether it makes sense to adjust the LiteBeam horizontally or vertically first.
    - Update to reflect realignment from BICAS to Tucson House, especially how to pick which sector router to connect to.
    - Incorporate a protocol for people to get their own login for the LiteBeam's admin interface.
    - Figure out what to do if someone needs to move the mount and update the cable run

This is a draft guide to help users and installers realign the [LiteBeam](../../hardware/litebeam.md) device on a home rooftop with the [supernode](../../networking/supernodes/index.md) at [Tucson House](../../networking/supernodes/tucson-house.md).

## Overview

There are a few broad stages to the realignment process. Even if you get stuck, completing the previous stage will make it easier for others to help you finish the rest.

- [Gather materials](gather-materials.md): Get the materials you will need to complete the other steps. This includes physical things like a ladder, software and login information for the rooftop routers. 
- [Use maps to find the supernode and check the line of sight](check-los-software.md): Before getting on your roof, use web maps to know where the supernode is located relative to your home. Optionally, check for any major obstructions using GIS software.
- [Physical check the line of sight](check-los-physical.md): Climb on your roof and look for obstructions between the router and the supernode. Would the line of sight be better if the router were mounted at a different place on the roof?
- [Adjust the router for the best signal strength](realign-litebeam.md): Connect to your router's administrative interface to monitor the signal strength. Rotate the router to get the strongest signal and tighten everything down.
