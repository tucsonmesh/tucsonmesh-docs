# DRAFT: Realignment

!!! info "How can this documentation be improved?" 

    - Clarify whether it makes sense to adjust the LiteBeam horizontally or vertically first.
    - Update to reflect realignment from BICAS to Tucson House, especially how to pick which sector router to connect to.
    - Incorporate a protocol for people to get their own login for the LiteBeam's admin interface.
    - Figure out what to do if someone needs to move the mount and update the cable run

This is a draft guide to help users and installers realign the [LiteBeam](../../hardware/litebeam.md) device on a home rooftop with a [supernode](../../networking/supernodes/index.md). Currently it reflects attempting to realign users after the supernode moved from the old BCC to [BICAS](../../networking/supernodes/bicas.md). Eventually it will reflect realigning devices to point to the [Tucson House](../../networking/supernodes/tucson-house.md) supernode instead.

## Overview

- [Gather equipment, install software and credentials](gather-materials.md)
- [Use free GIS software to orient yourself between the home node and the supernode and check line of site](check-los-software.md)
- [Climb on the roof and check the line of site](check-los-physical.md)
- [Climb on the roof and use the devices administrative interface to see how changing the vertical and horizontal angle of the device changes the signal strength when connecting to the supernode.](realign-litebeam.md)
