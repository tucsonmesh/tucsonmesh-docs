# Configuring routers

This guide covers the default configuration for devices we install at user nodes. 

Typical installs use two routers, the [Ubiquiti LightBeam AC Gen 2](../../hardware/litebeam.md) (often referred to as an "LBE"), which connects directly to the supernode, and [MikroTik OmniTIK 5 PoE ac](../../hardware/omnitik.md) (often referred to as an "Omni") to mesh with nearby omnis and spread the internet love to the rest of the neighborhood. You will have to configure both of these routers before heading out to the install.

You can find the guides for configuring these routers and others here:
