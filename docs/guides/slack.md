## What is Slack?

At it's core, Slack is a chat app that allows users to send DMs and chat in a variety of "channels." It has a number of additional features like attachments, collaborative documents and lists, and  video calls that make it a popular tool in many workplaces. It's similar to Microsoft Teams or Discord.

## Why do we use Slack?

Tucson Mesh aims to be a participatory project. Slack allows the admin team, users and other members of the Mesh community to discuss projects or technical challenges or view past discussion in a way that's easier to follow than an email, text thread or web message board. This is critical for responding to requests for help. As a volunteer-run project, members of the admin team are juggling other responsibilities while trying to help users. Slack makes it easy for different people to step in to continue helping someone if anyone has to step away. 

It works well on both desktop computers and mobile devices. It has a free tier and a [nonprofit discount](https://slack.com/help/articles/204368833-Apply-for-the-Slack-for-Nonprofits-discount).

## Connecting to Slack

You can use Slack [in your web browser](https://tucsonmesh.slack.com) or you can [download](https://slack.com/downloads/) the mobile or Desktop app.

## Getting help

Slack has an extensive [help center](https://slack.com/help) with guides to using the service. The [Using Slack](https://slack.com/help/categories/200111606) section has links to information about common tasks and terminology in the app.
