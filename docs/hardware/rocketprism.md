These are the radios for the sector antennas on the [Tucson House supernode](../networking/supernodes/tucson-house.md).

- `corner` is the corner of the building on which the radio is mounted: `NE`, `NW`, `SE`, `SW`
- `vertical_position` is the vertical slot where the radio is mounted: `Bottom`, `Middle`, `Top`
- `effective_direction` is the direction corresponding to the radio's slot: `N`, `S`, `E`, `W`, `NE`, `NW`, `SE`, `SW`
