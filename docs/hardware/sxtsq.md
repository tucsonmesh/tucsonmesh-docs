# MikroTik SXTsq 5 ac

Product page: [MikroTik Routers and Wireless - Products: SXTsq 5 ac](https://mikrotik.com/product/sxtsq_5_ac)

This is used to connect a node to a nearby node's [OmniTIK](./omnitik.md) or another SXT. It has a directional antenna.

This device runs MikroTik RouterOS, so it may be useful to consult the [RouterOS documentation](https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/). We've also started compiling documentation about common tasks in RouterOS in [RouterOS Tips](../guides/routeros-tips.md).
