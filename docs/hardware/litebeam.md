Along with the [MikroTik OmniTIK 5 PoE ac](omnitik.md), this is what most users have on their roofs.

We often refer to this device as an "LBE."

## Power over ethernet (PoE)

In typical installs, we power the LBE through PoE provided by the Omni, so we don't use the injector that comes with the device.

The LiteBeam PoE injector provides 24 V at 0.3 A for 7.2 W.

This does not provide enough power to use this injector to power an Omni.
