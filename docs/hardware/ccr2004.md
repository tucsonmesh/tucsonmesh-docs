The MikroTik CCR2004-16G-2S+ is used as the primary router for the [Tucson House supernode](../networking/supernodes/tucson-house.md).

If you are configuring one of these routers and it has been freshly reset or is fresh out of the box, you need to

- Connect to it over Ethernet into the `15/BOOT` port
- Manually assign your network interface to use an IP of `192.168.88.2/24` (`192.168.88.2` with a netmask of `255.255.255.0` and default gateway/route of `192.168.88.1`)
- Go to `http://192.168.88.1` or open Winbox and attempt to connect via IP or through the Neighbors tab
