# Mikrotik CSS610-8P-2S+IN

This is the model of _PoE Switch_ that we are using for the [Tucson House supernode](../networking/supernodes/tucson-house.md). They don't require any particular setup with the exception of naming them something other than Mikrotik.

If you connect directly over Ethernet with them, you can access the admin UI at `192.168.88.1` in the same fashion as above or, if it's been assigned an IP over DHCP, that IP.

- Switch 1:
