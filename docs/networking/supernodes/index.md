# Supernodes

In the network architecture we use, a "supernode" is a physical location with multiple antennas and a connection to the broader internet.

As of early April 2025, we have a supernode, [the one located at Bicas](bicas.md), with a second supernode [atop Tucson House](tucson-house.md) to be installed this month.
