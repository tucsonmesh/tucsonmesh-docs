Make sure all the devices are powered on. You may have two power supplies, one to power your home WiFi router and a second to power the poe (power over Ethernet) which in turn power the device(s) on the roof.
The poe is a device that power the devices on the roof through the Ethernet cable.
If you have only a WiFi router, then make sure it is powered and connected to the Ethernet cable coming from the roof.</description></item><item><title>Ubiquiti Firmware</title><link>/firmware/ubiquiti/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/firmware/ubiquiti/</guid><description>Ubiquiti firmware has some buggy versions that need to be avoided. In general never use a &amp;ldquo;.0&amp;rdquo; release. It is beta quality and will probably have serious bugs that may be fixed by .1 or .2 version.
Ubiquiti have two very separate product lines with different firmware, AirMAX and UniFi
Don&amp;rsquo;t use the latest firmware from Ubiquiti! Use the stable versions below-

Every mesh router at every node on the mesh gets an IP address from 10.69.0.0/16. Each router&amp;rsquo;s IP address can be computed from the router&amp;rsquo;s node number. The 10-69 network supports up to two routers per node.
The 10-69 network allows for routers at nodes to auto-discover each other using OSPF with minimal configuration. This makes it possible for anyone to join the mesh with almost no intervention from other mesh members.</description></item><item><title>60 GHz</title><link>/hardware/60ghz/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/hardware/60ghz/</guid><description>60 GHz is an unlicensed band that now has some cheap gigabit point to point (p2p) antennas that we are using.
60 GHz is extremely susceptible to &amp;ldquo;rain-fade&amp;rdquo;, which is why it is not used in licensed spectrum
Often these radios come with a 5GHz backup, which isn&amp;rsquo;t really useful for bandwidth but it will keep your link online during rain.

There&amp;rsquo;s a few simple things you can do to prevent this-
Use a socket and drill to tighten hose clamps fast. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to get the hose clamp tight with a screw driver. A socket and drill will get it really tight. You&amp;rsquo;ll need a socket set that has both american and metric sockets.
Put one layer of electrical tape under the hose clamp.</description></item><item><title>BGP</title><link>/networking/bgp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/networking/bgp/</guid><description>The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is an inter-Autonomous System routing protocol.
NYC Mesh no longer uses BGP within the mesh between neighbors / members. Use of BGP within the mesh was too static for the changing network, lacked some &amp;ldquo;automatic&amp;rdquo; properties, and made it difficult to train new people.
Use outside NYC Mesh BGP is a popular dynamic routing protocol as it is relatively simple to configure, scales well and enjoys support across multiple hardware and software vendors.</description></item><item><title>Chromebook</title><link>/hardware/chromebook/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/hardware/chromebook/</guid><description>Chromebooks are good for installs as they are cheap and all you need is a browser and a terminal anyway.

Basically we work on a system of trust. As we get to know new people we trust that they will do the right thing, and we gradually share access to locations and machines, and let them lead installs. During Covid it is obviously difficult to get to know people since we don&amp;rsquo;t get to socialize with everyone at our meetups, so zooms are the new way.</description></item><item><title>Custom Firmware (old)</title><link>/firmware/custom/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/firmware/custom/</guid><description>Old firmware Repositories Old firmware build instructions are in our nycmeshfeed repo&amp;rsquo;s README file.

Through this, services can be hosted, internal sites, etc.
Use 10.10.10.10 for your DNS server.
DNS configuration The DNS is hosted using standard DNS zones which are made available through the Knot Resolver and Knot DNS Server.
The zone and scripts are made available via git. Once the master branch is updated, the DNS servers will periodically update and refresh their configuration.</description></item><item><title>Equipment</title><link>/installs/equipment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/installs/equipment/</guid><description>To connect to NYC Mesh, you will need to install wireless networking equipment on a rooftop or outside a window. This page lists a range of equipment and tools that are commonly used for typical installations.

They come in three different sizes: small, medium, and large. These categories are not strict, and you will find many variants in the field. You can modify your hub to suit your needs and the needs of other mesh members in your area.
Small The smallest possible hub is a standard node, an OmniTik 5 POE ac, with an added LiteBeam AC connected to a sector antenna at another hub or supernode to give it a reliable upstream connection.</description></item><item><title>IP Mapping Idea</title><link>/networking/ipmappingidea/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/networking/ipmappingidea/</guid><description>Hi #architecture, I&amp;#39;d like to propose an algorithm for making a Node Number to IP mapping programmatically.

As a mesh, various nodes connect to each other in a non-hierarchical way, with traffic flowing in either direction, and rerouting traffic as nodes fail.
As with all mesh networks, we must balance between becoming too much of a &amp;ldquo;star&amp;rdquo; topology vs a &amp;ldquo;mesh&amp;rdquo; topology.
Neither is fully practical &amp;ndash; Not literally every node next to each other can all connect to each other, nor can we sustain unlimited nodes connecting to one rooftop.</description></item><item><title>MikroTik Netinstall Recovery</title><link>/firmware/mikrotik_netinstall_recovery/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/firmware/mikrotik_netinstall_recovery/</guid><description>How to resurrect a bootlooping OmniTIK with netinstall Symptoms OmniTIK boots up but continually reboots.

(more about AirMax )
LTU and AirMax are not compatible. You need a different device/antenna to connect to the LTU sector.
We have one LTU sector mounted on the west side of 1340-Saratoga. Try it. Here the approximate coverage.
The sector is a LTU-Rocket radio and a AM-5ac21-60 antenna. It is positioned about 260o azimut, and it&amp;rsquo;s a 60o angle.</description></item><item><title>Typical Installations</title><link>/intro/typical-installs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/intro/typical-installs/</guid><description>Please read our FAQ if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already.
The intention of this page is not to be technical but rather give to the non-technical person an understanding of a typical installation.
NYC Mesh is an &amp;ldquo;over the air&amp;rdquo; network. The aim is to connect rooftop to rooftop using different types of equipment based on geography and topology. And in doing so, to expand NYC Mesh network coverage to the next block and so on*.</description></item><item><title>Ubiquiti EdgePoint R6</title><link>/hardware/epr6/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/hardware/epr6/</guid><description>The EP-R6 is an outdoor rooftop switch/router with 6 ports (5 GigE, 1 SFP). It supports PoE, but only Ubiquiti&amp;rsquo;s 24v Passive PoE style, not any of the fancier types.
It can be configured in switch mode (just a switch, with a management console) or routing mode (hub node setup, BGP, etc).
Device specs are available at store.ubnt.com.
Reset To factory reset an EP-R6, press and hold the reset button, by the ethernet plugs, for about 10 seconds until the eth4 LED begins to flash, then release the button.</description></item><item><title>Ubiquiti LiteAP Sector</title><link>/hardware/liteap/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/hardware/liteap/</guid><description>The confusingly named LiteAP (LAP-120) is a very good, cheap 120&amp;rsquo; sector antenna. 120&amp;rsquo; means you need three to get a full 360&amp;rsquo;. It used to be called a LiteBeam 5AC AP LBE-5AC-16-120, and is still named that on parts of their website.
We use it as a sector antenna for most hub and supernode installs. As with all Ubiquiti gear you need to flash it with the latest firmware first.</description></item><item><title>Ubiquiti LiteBeam AC</title><link>/hardware/litebeamac/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/hardware/litebeamac/</guid><description>The LiteBeamAC is a very good, cheap directional router. We use it for most rooftop installs. As with all Ubiquiti gear you need to flash it with the latest firmware first. Often they ship with old beta firmware, and the latest firmware usually gets you faster speeds. Our config instructions are here.
The AC in the name is not 802.11ac, it is Ubiquiti&amp;rsquo;s own protocol. These devices can only connect to other Ubiquiti &amp;ldquo;AC&amp;rdquo; devices.</description></item><item><title>Ubiquiti Nanostation M5</title><link>/hardware/nsm5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/hardware/nsm5/</guid><description>The NanoStation M5 is a workhorse of mesh networks. There are two versions XM (pre 2016) and XW. It is 802.11n and 10/100 ethernet, so not the fastest on the block, but it has good support from OpenWRT. It also has two ethernet ports usually set up as WAN and LAN. Recent versions require downgrading AirOS before you flash.
For new installs we use the OmniTik router for meshing. The following page is mainly for our legacy installs.</description></item><item><title>Unifi Access Points</title><link>/hardware/unifi-ap/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/hardware/unifi-ap/</guid><description>We are using more UNIFI access points on installs these days. These devices are very frustrating to set up, so this document is designed to help.
As of 2021 the latest firmware 4.3.28 has very short uptime (&amp;lt;30 days), so we are using a stable older version 4.3.20 (copy this link)
Never use 4.3.28 or later, as the device will go down and require a site visit to reboot!
The devices are coming with very old firmware that isn&amp;rsquo;t even compatible with the controller so step one is to SSH into the AP and upgrade it to 4.</description></item><item><title>VPN</title><link>/networking/vpn/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/networking/vpn/</guid><description>The NYC Mesh Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a system that enables a computer that is physically disconnected from the rest of the NYC Mesh network (e.g., because it is too distant from existing nodes) to access the network. Put another way, it extends the NYC Mesh network to computers that are not physically part of the mesh. This is used for a number of different purposes, including to provide access to intra-mesh services, ease new node installations, bootstrap new neighborhoods, and more.</description></item><item><title>VPN - L2TP/IPsec</title><link>/networking/vpnl2tpipsec/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/networking/vpnl2tpipsec/</guid><description>L2TP/IPSec is a common general-purpose VPN protocol that work with most platforms. For example, computers running Windows, macOS, iPhones, and Android devices all support this type of VPN out-of-the-box. This type of VPN is a little bit oldschool, in that it is typically found in enterprise corporate environments, which is part of what makes it so ubiquitous. For this reason, we have decided to provide and endpoint of this protocol.</description></item><item><title>VPN - L2TP/IPsec Req.</title><link>/networking/vpnl2tpipsecid/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/networking/vpnl2tpipsecid/</guid><description>NYC Mesh maintains some common VPN infrastructure for use by active mesh members.
Please feel free to use the VPNs. However, please note that NYC Mesh is not a commercial VPN provider or reseller, nor are we trying to achieve an Internet-based darknet. The VPN service is subject to change and/or breakage at any time. Do not rely on NYC Mesh‚Äôs VPN service as your primary or critical VPN provider.

For comparison, the older L2TP/IPsec VPNs typically will achieve about 100Mbps, but WireGuard VPNs may reach speeds upward of 300-400Mbps on the same hardware, or higher on a high-end workstation.
In addition to its speed, WireGuard has some great features such as built-in roaming (a single encrypted packet moves the tunnel to your new IP), cryptokey routing, and formal cryptographic verification.</description></item><item><title>VPN - WireGuard + OSPF</title><link>/networking/vpnwireguardospf/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/networking/vpnwireguardospf/</guid><description>WireGuard is generally described on another page, here: [VPN - Wireguard]({{ relref &amp;ldquo;vpnwireguard.md&amp;rdquo;}}). This page is about what is needed to configure WireGuard for routing over the VPN; especially with a focus on OSPF.
A Note on Cryptokey Routing It&amp;rsquo;s worth a section to touch on the cryptokey routing feature of WireGuard and how it works with the mesh.
All WireGuard nodes list their peers in a configuration file. Among the peer configuration is a public key and a list of acceptable IP ranges for the peer.</description></item><item><title>Watchdog</title><link>/software/watchdog/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/software/watchdog/</guid><description>Wireless networks have a bit of a reputation for instability.
