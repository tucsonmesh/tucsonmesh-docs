Please read our [FAQ](https://nycmesh.net/faq) if you haven't already.

First you need to enter a [new node request](https://nycmesh.net/join). This will add your address to our list of requests and put your location on our map. If you have multiple locations enter them separately. If you are within range of a (blue) supernode or hub node, and have line-of-sight, we may be able to connect you.

The easiest option is for our install team to come out and do the install. After you submit the new node request we will check whether a connection is possible. If so we'll send a link so you can schedule an install. This costs $160 and covers everything needed.

If you want to DIY it is best to join our [Slack group](https://slack.nycmesh.net) and ask questions in the #install channel
