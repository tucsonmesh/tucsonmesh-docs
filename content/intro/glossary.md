**AP**: a wifi Access Point  
**ASN**: Autonomous System Number that identifies your network on BGP for [peering](../../networking/peering/). Our  number is [AS395853](https://www.peeringdb.com/asn/395853)  
**Backhaul**: very high bandwidth connections, often point to point.  
[**BGP**](../../networking/bgp/): This is the routing protocol of the Internet. We use it extensively to mesh our network and connect at an IXP  
**BMX6**: An ad-hoc mesh protocol we use. (BatMan eXperimental 6)  
**BuB**: “Bottom up Broadband” The beneficiaries of the networks actively participate in the planning, deployment and maintenance tasks.  
**Captive portal**: a web page that is shown before connecting to the Internet normally  
**Cjdns**: Caleb James DeLisle's Network Suite. Encrypted IPv6 mesh protocol.  
**Clearnet**: the regular internet as opposed to the hidden web (Tor, I2P, Freenet)  
**Commons**: The commons include public libraries, the Internet, parks and roads and some mesh networks. Guifi has a “Wireless Commons License”.  
**CPE**: Customer premises equipment (e.g. a LiteBeam, NanoStation, home router). ISP jargon  
**Dark fiber**: fiber cable that is not connected.  
**FFTF**: Fiber From The Farms Broadband Initiative -- Guifi term for BuB   
**FNF**: Free Network Foundation  
**Guifi**: The largest community owned network, based in Catalonia, Spain  
**IPv4**: the most common version of the Internet Protocol (IP), An IPv4 address consists of four octets e.g. 192.168.1.20  
**IPv6**: 6th version of Internet Protocol. Designed to replace IPv4. e.g. 2001:db8:0:1:1:1:1:1  
**HNA**: Host and Network Association information used by mesh protocols  
**LIR**: local Internet registry, an organization that has been allocated a block of IP addresses by a regional Internet registry (RIR)  
**LuCI**: (pronounced Lucy) Lua Unified Configuration Interface, the web interface in OpenWRT  
**MANET**: Mobile Ad-hoc NETwork  
**NAT**: Network address translation- a method of remapping one IP address space into another  
**node**: WiFi router or other routing devices in a particular location on a network   
**OLSR**: Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (popular mesh protocol)  
**OpenWRT**: Open source Wireless Receiver/Transmitter (WRT) software  
[**OSPF**](../../networking/ospf/): a popular dynamic routing protocol  
**P2P**: Point-to-point connection between two antennas  
**P2MP**: Point-to-multipoint connection, e.g. between one sector antenna and multiple smaller antennas  
**POE**: Power over ethernet (how Ubiquiti routers get 24 volt power)  
**Radio**: The wireless receiver/transmitter part of a router  
**RIR**: Regional Internet registry  
**SSID**: Service set identification- the Wi-Fi access point name  
**WAP**: Wireless Access Point  
**WDS**: Wireless Distribution System, A mesh protocol we use  
**WNDW**: Wireless Networking in the Developing World -- essential book  
**WRT**: Wireless Receiver/Transmitter software (WRT)
