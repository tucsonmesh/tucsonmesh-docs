For a DIY ("do it yourself") install we recommend [joining our Slack group](https://slack.nycmesh.net/) where you can chat with us.

There is a channel in Slack- [#diy-install-support](https://app.slack.com/client/T02MB96L1/CL7BDUTA7/thread/G0FS2EVSQ-1584108413.229000) where you can ask questions. We can guide you on what hardware to buy, and what is the likely best connection to a nearby antenna.

For DIY, **you must still** [fill in our join form](https://nycmesh.net/join). This will give you an Install Number (or request number) which you will need when you are ready for an install to request a **Network Number** (or **NN**) in order to be able to configure your devices for your install. It will also get you in our system so we can give you advice and look for line-of-sight connections, as well as put you on the map.  *(We are working at automating the process so you can use the Install Request number and the system will automatically allocate a Network Number for you. For now you need to request it via #diy-install-suport or via the email your received with your Request Install Number)*

For a quick check of line-of-sight you can use our [line-of-sight tool](https://los.nycmesh.net). Put in your address and it will show you which hubs you might be able to connect to.

Here is a [list of equipment we typically use](../installs/equipment/). Remember to use outdoor ethernet cable, and securely mount your antennas on j-pipes or secured masts. Masts should be strong metal as plastic PVC pipes will bend.

Our general install advice is here in [the docs](../installs/)

When you are ready, here how to [configure](../hardware/config)  your devices.

We ask you, if you can, to support NYC Mesh with a [monthly subscription](https://nycmesh.net/donate). Donating helps maintain, operate and expand NYC Mesh so, just like you, others can benefit from the network.
