For DIY we recommend [joining our Slack group](https://slack.nycmesh.net/) where you can chat with us.

There is a channel in Slack- #diy-install-support where you can ask questions.

For DIY, you should still [fill in our join form](https://nycmesh.net/join). This will give you a request number (or node number) which you will need for your install. It will also get you in our system so we can give you advice and look for line-of-sight connections.

For a quick check for line-of-sight you can use our [line-of-sight tool](https://los.nycmesh.net). Put in your address and it will show you which hubs you might be able to connect to. 

Our general install advice is here in [the docs](../installs/)

We ask you, if you can, to support NYC Mesh with a [monthly subscription](https://nycmesh.net/donate). Donating helps maintain, operate and expand NYC Mesh so, just like you, others can benefit from the network.
