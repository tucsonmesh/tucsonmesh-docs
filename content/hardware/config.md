### <a name="lbe-client"></a>Litebeam client for Supernodes and hubs

All Supernodes and hubs (apart from SN1) use the same sn2.cfg. Supernode 1 has a slightly different config (sn1.cnf) and it also needs an assigned IP address. 

First download the [firmware](https://www.ubnt.com/download/airmax-ac/litebeam-ac-gen2/lbe-5ac-gen2) and the [sn1 config file](/download/sn1.html) and [sn2 config file](/download/sn2.html) and save to a folder for offline use. Also save these instructions (Cmd-S).

Plug in LiteBeam to POE and connect via management wifi- SSID- "LBE-5AC-Gen2:...." or "NBE..." (booting turns on wifi for 15 minutes)

Go to https://192.168.172.1 in your browser, click "advanced" to proceed.

Log in with username: ubnt and password: ubnt for a new device (or select upload config!)

Go to Settings>System and select "upload firmware" and choose the WA .bin file you downloaded before

While still in System, scroll down to "upload configuration" and select sn1.cfg or sn2.cfg file you downloaded before

Change the "nn" device name from lbe-nycmesh-nn to your node number e.g. lbe-nycmesh-1234

For SN1 **only**, Go to Network and change the management IP address (192.168.1.20) to the assigned IP address we have given you (192.168.42.xxx)  

Click save (twice if necessary)  

To pair with the supernode or hub, go to Settings>Wireless and click the SSID "SELECT..." button. This will do a scan. Click the button next to the best AirMac AC signal. (-80 is bad, -50 is good) Click "SELECT" and then "SAVE CHANGES" (twice if necessary)

For SN2+ and hubs, once this device pairs (numbers appear on dashboard) it will get a different management IP address using DHCP. To stay logged in to router, you must use the management wifi!

To disconnect from the LiteBeam dashboard and do a bandwidth test, connect via ethernet and set your network settings to "DHCP" (or "Automatic") and go to [speedtest](http://www.speedtest.net/)

Troubleshooting: If you are unable to log into the LiteBeam, reset it to factory defaults- press and hold the Reset button for more than 10 seconds while the LiteBeam ac is already powered on.

### <a name="sxtKiosk"></a>SXTsq kiosk  

**This config may not work with Windows computers**
  
The following works with a new SXTsq or a reset SXTsq. You must have the "International" version. To reset an SXTsq, hold the reset button for about 5 seconds while the unit is booting and release as soon as green LED starts flashing (to reset RouterOS configuration to defaults).

Connect to the SXTsq via ethernet and DHCP. You will get a 192.168.88.xxx address
  
In the terminal
```
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no admin@192.168.88.1
```   
Say 'yes' to the warning and paste this-  
  
```  
/interface wireless security-profiles

/interface wireless connect-list  
add interface=wlan1 security-profile=linknyc ssid="LinkNYC Private" wireless-protocol=802.11  
  
```  
  
This script automatically connects the SXTsq to the private LinkNYC Kiosk channel. No login is required.

### <a name="sxtVpn"></a>SXTsq Kiosk + VPN  

[About VPN](/networking/vpn)

**We're currently having problems with this config. It allows Windows computers to connect but introduces another problem ith L2TP/IPSEC and the way the kiosks assign public IP addresses. Help us solve this if you can!**

This adds a VPN to the configuration so you will be connected to the mesh network over a virtual private network.  This bypasses any possible privacy issues of using the kiosk. This will limit your connection to around 100Mbps (still fast) but could go faster as the router cpu must work harder to encrypt the data for a VPN connection. It's a limitation of the hardware, SXT in this case, not of the vpn.
  
The following works with a new SXTsq or a reset SXTsq. You must have the "International" version. To reset an SXTsq, hold the reset button for about 5 seconds while the unit is booting and release as soon as green LED starts flashing (to reset RouterOS configuration to defaults).
  
Connect to the SXTsq via ethernet and DHCP. You will get a 192.168.88.xxx address

### <a name="sxtClient"></a>SXTsq Client    
  
  
Set your computer to connect using DHCP ("automatic" on PC)  
Connect via ethernet and you will get an address like 192.168.88.xxx
  
**Reset**  
press the reset button WHILE powering on the unit by plugging in the POE cable.  
Once one of the LEDs begins to flash white/blue (about 5 seconds), release reset button while it's flashing. After one minute the device will be ready  
  
**Connect to GUI**  
open your browser and connect to http://192.168.88.1/  
default username: admin  
default password: (leave empty)  
Click the button that says "Webfig" in the top right  
  
**Name the device**   
system > identity  
"n<your-node-id>-<device-type>-<index>". So if your node id is 1000, your device name could be: n1000-sxt-0  
  
**Set a password**  
System > password  
IMPORTANT: You must use a unique and strong (at least 8 characters, the longer the better) password to ensure the security of your device!  

**IP > Services**  
- Disable telnet  
- Disable ftp  
- Consider disabling the api and winbox services if you will not be using them.  

Other security precautions to consider
https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Manual:Securing_Your_Router

  
**IP > firewall**  
Find and disable this input rule:  
4  
;;; defconf: drop all not coming from LAN  
  
**Bridge**  
- add new  
set Protocol Mode to "none"  
- hit apply and OK  
  
**IP > DHCP Server**  
disable by clicking the small [D] button  
  
**IP > DHCP Client**  
- change Interface to bridge1  
- hit apply and OK  
  
**Wireless > security profiles (tab)**   
add new  
name: nycmeshnet  
uncheck wpa psk  
leave wpa2 psk checked  
write in wpa2 Pre-Shared-Key field: nycmeshnet  
apply and ok  
  
**Wireless > wlan1**  
Set mode to station-bridge  
Set SSID of the hub you want to connect to e.g. nycmesh-xxx   
Set channel width to 20/40/80MHz XXXX  
Set frequency to auto  
Set security profile to nycmeshnet  
(below only if you have SXT international version)  
Click Advanced Mode button at top  
Scroll down and set country drop down to united states   
  
When all settings are correct and the station connects the status should change from "searching for network" to "connected to ess".  
  
**Bridge > Ports**   
Add new, set interface to ether1, set bridge to bridge1  
Add new, set interface to wlan1, set bridge to bridge1  
  
**IP  > Addresses**   
- Add new, set address to 192.168.88.1/24 set interface to bridge1
- Delete entry 192.168.88.1/24 on interface ether1

**Change your computer network settings back to automatic or DHCP**  
(Note you must be connected to the access point to proceed beyond this point)
  
**Access GUI via routable IP address**  
Use the name you used for your device, plus the name of the access point to generate the correct URL. For example if your node id is 1000 and the hub id is 500, the URL would be:  
http://n1000-sxt-0.n500.mesh/  

**Update (2 step process)**   
1. system > packages  
- enable ipv6   
- update / reboot  
2. system > routerboard > update  
Reboot

### <a name="sxtP2P"></a>SXTsq Point-to-Point  (PtP)  
  
  
  The following works with two new SXTsq or a reset SXTsq. To reset an SXTsq, hold the reset button for about 5 seconds while the unit is booting and release as soon as green LED starts flashing (to reset RouterOS configuration to defaults). It is recommended to update the firmware of your SXTsq to the latest. The under has been tested with firmware v.6.43.12
  
  One of the SXT will act as an "AP" but can be associated to only one "client". The second SXT will be the "client".
  
  After the configuration there will be no DHCP Server or Client, thus you will need to configure your laptop IP mannually in the same network range, for exemple  192.168.88.11
  
The SXT-AP and SXT-Client port address will be change in order to not interfere with another potential SXT default IP.  
- AP will be ether1:  192.168.88.2  and bridge1:  192.168.88.3  
 - Client will be ether1:  192.168.88.4  and bridge1:  192.168.88.5  
 
Connect to the SXTsq via ethernet and DHCP. You will get a 192.168.88.xxx address
