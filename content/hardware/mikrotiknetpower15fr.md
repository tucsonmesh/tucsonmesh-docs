The NetPower 15FR is an outdoor 16 ethernet ports Switch with PoE output on one port. Since the device has a waterproof outdoor case, you can mount it on a tower, or in other outdoor locations.

It supports passive PoE input on 15 ports and passive PoE output on one.
We successfuly used this device to Power one OmniTik POE 5 ac which in turn powered an SXTsq G-5acD and thus were able to connect 9 apartments to NYC Mesh.
