An indoor router, connected by ethernet cable to the outdoor router, is required for an NYC Mesh member to connect their personal devices to the Internet. For volunteer-led installations, the install team will supply the new member with a [TP-Link N300 Router](https://www.tp-link.com/us/products/details/cat-9_TL-WR841N.html).

### Pre-Configuration Best Practices
**For volunteer installers**

Before configuring, ask the user member to tell you:

* Whether they would like to use the TP-Link router we supply or their own router
* A username and password for the router
* An SSID and password for the home wireless network

### Optional TP-Link TL-WR841N Firmware Upgrade
**For volunteer installers**

If you have time you should pre-configure the router as much as possible, including upgrading the firmware to the latest version. To do that the router does not need to be connected to a network. It can be pre-configured following the above steps excluding point 1.

1.  Download the latest firmware file [here](https://www.tp-link.com/us/download/TL-WR841N.html#Firmware).
1.  Connect to **192.168.0.1** and log in with the username and password you set for the router.
1.  Go to System Tools > Firmware Upgrade.
1.  Click Choose File to locate the downloaded firmware file, and click Upgrade.
1.  Setting the time is not a necessity but nice to do. Go to System Tools > Time Settings. You can use [apple NTP](http://time.apple.com), [pool.org](http://pool.ntp.org) and/or [Google](http://time1.google.com).
