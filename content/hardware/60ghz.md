title: "60 GHz"
---

60 GHz is an unlicensed band that now has some cheap gigabit point to point (p2p) antennas that we are using.

60 GHz is extremely susceptible to "rain-fade", which is why it is not used in licensed spectrum

Often these radios come with a 5GHz backup, which isn't really useful for bandwidth but it will keep your link online during rain.

## MikroTik LHG 60G

- Price $300 pair  
- Range 200m 
- 5GHs backup: no
- Tested speed: 700 Mbps

We originally installed these for 800m links but they will go down every time in heavy rain. 200m seems a good distance for them. It's a cheap way to connect neighboring buildings. We use these between the Grand St towers.

## IgniteNet Metrolink One 60-19

- Price: $500 pair  
- Range: 200m?  
- 5GHz backup: yes
- Tested speed: 300 

We use these between Henry and Grand. It never got over 300 Mbps

- The mount is extremely heavy and obviously designed for the larger antenna
- The lights on the back aren't visible due to the mount
- It is possible to mount on horizontal pipe but you only have ~15 degrees of movement
- Bandwidth is about half of the cheaper Mikrotik 60Ghz
- Maybe we should have used the larger 60 â€“ 35
- The backup 5GHz is strangely very low bandwidth (~20 Mbps)
- The telescope is very good, and great for aligning
- Everything is very well built and feels like a scientific instrument

# Ubiquiti

There's a very confusing range of Ubiquiti 60GHz. There's basically there's dishes and enclosed headlight looking ones

## Ubiquiti Gigabeam (headlight)

- Price: $260 pair
- no quoted range! (assume it's meant for neighboring buildings)
- 5GHz backup:

## Ubiquiti Gigabeam Plus GBE-Plus (headlight)

- Price: $360 pair
- Range: "up to 1.5km"
- 5GHz backup: no

## Ubiquiti Gigabeam GBE-LR (dish)

- Price: $400 pair
- Range: "long range"? probably means "up to 2km" like the af60
- 5GHz backup: no

## Ubiquiti airFiber 60 (dish)

- Price: $600 pair
- Range: "Long range, up to 2 km"
- 5GHz backup: yes

Similar looking to the MikroTik LHG 60G. 

## Ubiquiti airFiber 60 LR (dish)

- Price: $800 pair (sold as matched pair)
- Range: "Long Range, Up to 12 km" (hard to believe!)
- 5GHz: no
