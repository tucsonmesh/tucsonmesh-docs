**Courtesy and Respect on Installs**

You, the installer, are the public face of NYCMesh! Courtesy, respect, friendliness and
professionalism will give install members a great first impression of our organization and
will encourage them to become active members.

**Before the Install**

Check the weather forecast the day of the install. If you have to cancel due to weather
conditions, inform the install team on slack, call the member and ask the member to
reschedule using their ticket.

Check to see if member has paid the main install fee.

Before leaving for the install, hydrate, eat something and use the bathroom. Bring bottled
water and a snack with you.

Download the slack app and turn on push notifications to communicate efficiently with your
fellow installers.

Check MTA delays and allow sufficient time to get to the install. If you can’t help being
late, call or text your member and update your co-installers on slack.

**When You Arrive at the Site**

When meeting a member, introduce yourself by name and explain how you plan to carry out
the install. Ask them if they have any questions and confirm that they will be able to
host you for the expected duration of the install. Be polite and friendly!

Be sensitive to cultural and social differences, such as:

* Attitudes towards physical contact. For example, some people may not feel comfortable
shaking hands upon meeting.
* Wearing or not wearing outdoor footwear in the apartment. Ask for permission to wear
shoes indoors if in doubt.
* Language barriers. Be patient with members whom you don’t share a first language with.
* Physical abilities. members who are elderly or have a medical condition may not be
able to accompany you to the roof or help move furniture.

Ask your member to lead you to their roof. If they are unable to do so, ask them to
explain how to access the roof and request that they point out any hazards.

Ask your member to show you around their apartment. Ask where the bathroom is in case you need to use it. Remember to respect the member’s privacy.

Discuss options for cabling into the apartment with your member during your initial tour
of their apartment. Ask for permission before carrying out any drilling.

Consider taking your boots off inside the apartment. Some apartments insist on this, and also your boots are probably dirty. Molten tar on roofs is a big problem in summer and will stick to everything. Snow in winter will melt.

**During the Install**

The install leader will assign tasks as per volunteers abilities. Minimal time should be wasted.

Maintain a tidy workspace. Clean up as you go. Keep an eye on wire casings you've stripped
off.

Carry out the install quickly and efficiently but do not rush or compromise safety. Do not goof off or waste time.

If you need to move anything, ask permission or ask them to help you if they are able. 
If you run into installation issues and feel frustrated, try to maintain a positive
attitude when communicating with the member and with your fellow installers. Resolve issues efficiently and post questions to the #install-team slack channel.

If the install is taking longer than planned, tell the member. Confirm they will be able to host you for the extended install duration.

If for any reason you need to halt the install (eg. weather or unsafe conditions), respectfully explain the situation to the member.

**At the End of the Install**

Take photos of the install, preferably with happy member in background. Photos are used to evaluate the install for problems, and the best photos are tweeted

After finishing the install, have a friendly conversation with your member about the mission of NYCMesh and encourage them to get involved as a volunteer. Invite them to our next
[meetup](https://www.meetup.com/nycmesh/). Avoid excessive casual conversation during install as this can increase install time by hours.


Politely remind your member to pay the labor fee and the installation fee (if they have
not already paid it).

Split the labor fee with your fellow employees.

Pat yourself on the back! You just helped NYCMesh grow by another node!
