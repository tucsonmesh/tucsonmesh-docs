title: "TP-Link Indoor Router"
---

An indoor router, connected by ethernet cable to the outdoor router, is required for an NYC Mesh member to connect their personal devices to the Internet. For volunteer-led installations, the install team will supply the new member with a [TP-Link N300 Router](https://www.tp-link.com/us/products/details/cat-9_TL-WR841N.html).

[Here the link to configure the router](/hardware/tplink/)
