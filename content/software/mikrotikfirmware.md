title: "MikroTik Firmware"
---

Mikrotik devices come in a variety of architectures and form-factors. Fortunately the firmware versioning and built levels are the same across all platforms. The main variant is the architecture, which might be a different chip for each device model.  

We follow the stable version of RouterOS (__6.46.1__), which is fairly well-tested, so there is little reason to wait to update after a new version comes out.

Below is a table of the latest firmwares for Mikrotik devices that are in the mesh:
