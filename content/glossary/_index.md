Telecommunications, computing, and internetworking technologies often have an enormous amount of jargon associated with them. This jargon makes it possible to speak precisely and quickly to others who are in-the-know, but can also drastically increase the learning curve for newcomers. We offer this page as a quick reference guide for common terms, acronyms, and other abbreviations that NYC Mesh technical teams use on a regular basis.

# A

Antenna
: Antenna, router and radio are often confused- [see our FAQ](https://www.nycmesh.net/faq#defrouter)

AP
: a wifi Access Point

ARIN
: American Registry for Internet Numbers- where you get your ASN

ASN
: Autonomous System Number that identifies your network on BGP for [peering](../../networking/peering/). Our  number is [AS395853](https://www.peeringdb.com/asn/395853)

# B

Backhaul
: very high bandwidth connections, usually point to point.

[BGP](../../networking/bgp/)
: This is the routing protocol of the Internet. We use it extensively to mesh our network and to connect at an IXP

BMX6
: An ad-hoc mesh protocol we use. (BatMan eXperimental 6)

BuB
: “Bottom up Broadband” The beneficiaries of the networks actively participate in the planning, deployment and maintenance tasks.

# C

Captive portal
: a web page that is shown before connecting to the Internet normally

Cjdns
: Caleb James DeLisle's Network Suite. Encrypted IPv6 mesh protocol.

Clearnet
: the regular internet as opposed to the hidden web (Tor, I2P, Freenet)

Commons
: The commons include public libraries, the Internet, parks and roads and some mesh networks. Guifi has a “Wireless Commons License”.

CPE
: Customer premises equipment (e.g. a LiteBeam, NanoStation, home router). ISP jargon

# D

Dark fiber
: fiber cable that is not connected.

DHCP
: or "Automatic" setting will automatically try to get you an IP address and subnet mask

# E

# F

FFTF
: Fiber From The Farms Broadband Initiative -- Guifi term for BuB 

FNF
: Free Network Foundation

# G

Guifi
: The largest community owned network, based in Catalonia, Spain

# H

HNA
: Host and Network Association information used by mesh protocols

# I

IPv4
: the most common version of the Internet Protocol (IP), An IPv4 address consists of four octets e.g. 192.168.1.20

IPv6
: 6th version of Internet Protocol. Designed to replace IPv4. e.g. 2001:db8:0:1:1:1:1:1

ISP
: Internet Service Provider

# J

# K

# L

LIR

: Mobile Ad-hoc NETwork

# N

NAT
: Network address translation- a method of remapping one IP address space into another

node
: WiFi router or other routing devices in a particular location on a network 

# O

OLSR

OpenWRT
: Open source Wireless Receiver/Transmitter (WRT) software

[OSPF](../../networking/ospf/)
: a popular dynamic routing protocol

# P

[Peering](../../networking/peering/)
: An agreement between two networks to connect and exchange traffic without charge

P2P
: Point-to-point connection between two antennas

P2MP
: Point-to-multipoint connection, e.g. between one sector antenna and multiple smaller antennas

POE
: Power over ethernet (how Ubiquiti routers get 24 volt power)
