NYC Mesh is a mesh network.   
To understand a bit more about our Mesh network design concepts, please see [Mesh Design](/networking/mesh)  

For more information on our networking concepts at a high level, please see:

* [Mesh Design](/networking/mesh)
* [Supernode Architecture](/networking/supernode-architecture/)


We use the following routing protocols:

* [BGP](/networking/bgp): Hub-to-Hub, some Rooftops, and to the Internet
* [OSPF](/networking/ospf): Hubs to Rooftops, Rooftops to Rooftops, and in some VPNs
* BMX6: Older Openwrt Nodes (c. 2015), (**Write-up pending**)

You can connect to the network through:

* Finding a Node. See [Nodes](/nodes)
* VPN to the Mesh. See [VPN](/networking/vpn)
