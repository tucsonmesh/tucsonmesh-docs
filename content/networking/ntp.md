## NTP Infrastructure
NYCMesh does not have yet a Mesh NTP server but 2 mesh members are providing NTP function on their server.   
Use **10.10.10.123** as your NTP server address.

## What is NTP
The Netwok Time Protocol is  a "network" protocol for devices to sych their clocks. See [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol)  

## IPs
**10.10.10.123** - NTP for the mesh ( **Use this one** )
