The **NYC Mesh Virtual Private Network (VPN)** is a system that enables a computer that is physically disconnected from the rest of the NYC Mesh network (e.g., because it is too distant from existing [nodes]({{< relref "nodes/_index.md" >}})) to access the other computers that make up the NYC Mesh network. Put another way, it extends the NYC Mesh network to computers that are not physically part of the mesh. This is used for a number of different purposes, including to provide access to intra-mesh services, ease new node installations, and more.

## VPN Infrastructure
NYC Mesh maintains some common [virtual private networking (VPN)](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) infrastructure for use by mesh members. The purpose of the VPN systems is to:

* connect distant nodes,
* provide backup for low-quality links,
* give access to intra-mesh resources to remote users (who are in a coffee shop, for example),
* provide access to administrative functions,
* etcetera.

Please feel free to use the VPNs as you see fit. They are for everyone. :) However, please note that NYC Mesh is not a (commercial) VPN provider or reseller, nor are we trying to achieve an Internet-based [darknet](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet). The VPN service is subject to change and/or breakage at any time. Do not rely on NYC Mesh's VPN service as your primary or critical VPN provider.

## When might you use a VPN
We run a VPN service for a variety of reasons. You might want to use the NYC Mesh VPN to:

* **tie distant neighborhoods together.** For instance, if a distant part of the mesh is too far away from the other nodes to make a reliable physical connection, you can use the VPN to (logically) tie the mesh back together and make intra-mesh services available over the public Internet to the physically separated part of the NYC Mesh network. This isn't required, of course; the distant portion of the mesh can have its own connection to the Internet (an exit node) and maintain itself locally, but without a VPN connection it won't be able to access the rest of the mesh.
* **connect your laptop to NYC Mesh over the public Internet.** For example, if you are working in a coffee shop but need access to the mesh in order to conduct tests or develop and maintain mesh-specific features, you can connect to the mesh via the VPN. As another example, you can masquerade to Web sites and public Internet services as a NYC Mesh user, so that you can see the Internet from NYC Mesh's "point of view."
* **configure networking equipment during an NYC Mesh [installation]({{< relref "installs/_index.md" >}}).** An installation may involve connecting to another node to configure it, which can be difficult to accomplish without already being on the mesh. By using a VPN connection, an install team member can temporary become part of the mesh prior to the completion of the physical installation.

## VPN types and endpoints
Each Supernode can (or, eventually, will) provide a few VPN options, depending on the Supernode's locally available hardware. You may connect to any or all of the supernodes and, in some cases, you can even connect to multiple supernodes simultaneously (for example, with BGP peering you can connect to multiple). For the documented currently available endpoints, see [ยง endpoints]({{< relref "#endpoints" >}}), below.

### Choosing a VPN endpoint

Although you can generally use whatever endpoint you wish, you should consider a combination of factors for the best experience using the NYC Mesh VPN service. These considerations include:

* VPN software support on your computer.
* VPN protocol support provided by the NYC Mesh VPN endpoint.
* Your goal in connecting via the VPN; do you intend to connect a single device (laptop, phone, home router, etc.), or will you do meshing?

Based on these decisions, you will need to choose a different protocol and setup procedure. For example, if your computer does not support any of the VPN protocols our endpoints do, you may need to connect using a different laptop.

### Endpoint types

The NYC Mesh VPN service currently offers VPN connectivity using the following protocols:

#### [L2TP/IPsec]({{< relref "networking/vpnl2tpipsec" >}})

VPNs that use a combination of the Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) and Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) protocols are a common general-purpose VPN deployment that work with most platforms. For example, computers running the Microsoft Windows and macOS operating systems support this type of VPN out-of-the-box. This type of VPN is a little bit oldschool in that it is typically found in enterprise corporate environments and thus does not provide much "mesh-y" functionality. It can also be a little slow.

NYC Mesh provides this type of endpoint because it is out-of-the-box compatible with most devices. We also **allow anonymous connections** to the NYC Mesh network via this VPN type.

For configuration instructions, please see our [L2TP/IPsec page]({{< relref "networking/vpnl2tpipsec" >}}).

#### [WireGuard]({{< relref "networking/vpnwireguard" >}})

[WireGuard]({{< relref "networking/vpnwireguard" >}}) is a modern type of VPN that was originally developed for Linux. There are now versions of the Wireguard VPN client software available for recent macOS and Windows operating systems as well. WireGuard is also very fast, but has some funny routing requirements.

#### Other VPN types

Other VPN protocols exist, but are either not offered by NYC Mesh endpoints or are not documented. These include:

* [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/): Good General purpose VPN, works with most platforms, usually pretty fast on computers/servers but very slow on embedded devices.
* VTrunkD: Experimental VPN for bonding multiple connections together. Interesting concept.
* Others?
