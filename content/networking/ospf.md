Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a routing protocol. It uses a link state routing (LSR) algorithm and falls into the group of interior gateway protocols (IGPs), operating within a single autonomous system (AS).

OSPF detects changes in the topology, such as link failures, and converges on a new loop-free routing structure within seconds. OSPF has become a popular dynamic routing protocol.
