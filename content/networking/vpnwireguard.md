title: "VPN - WireGuard"
---

[WireGuard](https://wireguard.com/) is a new, simple, and fast VPN implementation and protocol. For comparison, the older [L2TP/IPsec VPNs]({{< relref "vpnl2tpipsec.md" >}}) typically will achieve about 100Mbps, but WireGuard VPNs may reach speeds upward of 300-400Mbps on the same hardware, or higher on a high-end workstation.

In addition to its speed, WireGuard has some great features such as [built-in roaming](https://www.wireguard.com/#built-in-roaming) (a single encrypted packet moves the tunnel to your new IP), [cryptokey routing](https://www.wireguard.com/#cryptokey-routing), and formal cryptographic verification.

On the other hand, it also has some challenges, such as pre-key exchange and a lack of automatic address assignment. Both of these problems require manual configuration on both ends of the tunnel. Cryptokey routing also presents its own challenges in some situations (see [ยง A Note on Cryptokey Routing]({{< relref "#a-note-on-cryptokey-routing" >}})).

A WireGuard VPN is best suited for connecting single end-user devices such as laptops and phones to the mesh over the internet from a location that has no mesh access.

## Routing over WireGuard
WireGuard, like other VPNs, can be used in conjuction with a routing protocol, such as [OSPF]( relref "ospf.md") which we use in NYC Mesh. However, there are some challenges with WireGuard and routing.

These challenge are highlighted on another page, as it is a longer and more technical discussion.

Please see [VPN - WireGuard + OSPF]({{ relref "vpnwireguardospf.md"}})

## Device support
WireGuard implementations are being developed on a variety of platforms. The following list provides an overview, but see the [WireGuard Installation](https://www.wireguard.com/install/) instructions for further details.

* Linux: Yes!
* Android devices: Yes, some - See WireGuard website
* OpenWRT: Yes, in LEDE on latest versions, in certain builds
* Apple devices: Yes, some - See Wireguard website
* Mikrotik devices: No
* Ubnt routers: No (well, technically yes, but the module has caused lots of problems, so please don't use it yet)
* Windows devices: Yes, some - See WireGuard website

## Endpoints

### Supernode 1:
* IPv4/6: `wgvpn.sn1.mesh.nycmesh.net:51820`
* Supported connect methods:
    * End Device
    * ~~OSPF - _Not Yet_~~
    * ~~BGP Node-Peering - _Now legacy, please do not use_~~

### Supernode 3:
* IPv4/6: `wgvpn.sn3.mesh.nycmesh.net:51820`
* Supported connect methods:
    * End Device
    * OSPF Node-Peering

## How To Connect

### Connecting end-devices
1. Ensure WireGuard will work on your device
1. Generate a public key, and give it to Zach.
1. Zach will give you the server public key and assign you an IP address. _This will change later, but just for now to get the docs out, this is what we currently do._
