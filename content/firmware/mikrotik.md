title: MikroTik Firmware
---

MikroTik routerOS 6 firmware is generally stable. We are using 6.47.x

Download 6.47.10 [mipsbe here](https://download.mikrotik.com/routeros/6.47.10/routeros-mipsbe-6.47.10.npk) and [arm here](https://download.mikrotik.com/routeros/6.47.10/routeros-arm-6.47.10.npk)

Remember that OmniTiks use the "mipsbe" firmware and SXT's use the "arm" firmware due to different processors.

We have had some crashes with 6.48 so we aren't recommending it yet


**routerOS 7**

Don't use!

This has finally been released but it doesn't work with our configuration yet. We keep testing it as we are eager to use the newly added WireGuard.
