# Tucson Mesh Technical Documentation

This is the technical documentation for [Tucson Mesh](https://www.tucsonmesh.net/), a low-cost, community-controlled wireless internet provider in Tucson, Arizona.

This documentation is written as [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files that are turned into a website using [MKDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the [Material for MKDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme.

It originally started as a fork of [nycmeshnet/docs](https://github.com/nycmeshnet/docs), and draws inspiration from the organization of its successor, [wiki.nycmesh.net](https://wiki.nycmesh.net/).
